<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md107"></a>
How TCP Works</h3>
<p>The TCP protocol relies on several mechanisms to ensure reliable and ordered communication between a client and a server:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Connection Establishment</b>: Before data can be exchanged, TCP establishes a connection between the two parties through a three-step process called the handshake.</li>
<li><b>Reliable Transmission</b>: TCP guarantees that all data sent by the client arrives in order and without errors at the server.</li>
<li><b>Flow Control</b>: TCP dynamically adjusts the amount of data sent based on the recipient's capacity to receive it, to avoid overwhelming the recipient.</li>
<li><b>Connection Termination</b>: Once the transmission is complete, TCP closes the connection cleanly through a defined process.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md108"></a>
Advantages of TCP</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Reliability</b>: TCP ensures that all transmitted data arrives at its destination without errors, in the correct order, and without duplication.</li>
<li><b>Flow and Congestion Control</b>: TCP dynamically adjusts the amount of data sent to adapt to network conditions.</li>
<li><b>Ordered Transmission</b>: Data segments are reassembled in the correct order by the receiver, even if the packets arrive out of order.</li>
<li><b>Automatic Error Recovery</b>: If data segments are lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP ensures that they are retransmitted.</li>
</ul>

Architecture of the Rooms and Lobby</h2>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the player management structure in the game server, comprising several rooms and a lobby. This architecture has been designed to efficiently handle player connections and interactions within the game. Here is a detailed explanation of the key components and how they function:</p>
<p><img src="../../technicalAssets/room.png" alt="Alt text" class="inline"/></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md111"></a>
1. Lobby</h3>
<p>The lobby is the welcome area where players can gather before joining a game room. It allows players to connect, chat, and choose the room they want to enter. Players can also see who is online (e.g., P4, P5) and select their room.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md112"></a>
2. Rooms</h3>
<p>Each room is a dedicated space for gameplay. The rooms (Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, Room 4, etc.) allow players to compete in matches. Each room can accommodate multiple players (P1, P2, P3, etc.) and has its own game logic. Rooms are configurable for specific games, allowing flexibility in the type of game offered.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md113"></a>
3. Game Management</h3>
<p>Next to the rooms, the server can create games (Game 2, Game 3, etc.) where players are assigned to specific teams. This allows for multiple games to be managed simultaneously, isolating players in different rooms.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md114"></a>
4. Communication via TCP</h3>
<p>This architecture has been implemented using the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reliability</b>: TCP guarantees the delivery of data packets in the correct order. This is essential in a gaming environment where every action and movement of players must be correctly synchronized and received.</li>
<li><b>Flow and Congestion Control</b>: TCP automatically adjusts the data transmission rate between the server and clients, which is crucial for maintaining a smooth gaming experience, even if the network is congested.</li>
<li><b>Persistent Connection</b>: With TCP, a connection is established between the client and server until one side decides to close it. This facilitates continuous interactions, such as real-time updates of player states in the lobby and rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md115"></a>
Conclusion</h3>
<p>The architecture of the rooms and the lobby, implemented with TCP, provides a robust and effective solution for managing player interactions in the game. It ensures smooth and reliable communication, which is essential for an immersive and dynamic gaming experience.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md117"></a>
UDP</h2>
<p>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communication protocol used on the Internet for the fast sending of messages or <b>datagrams</b> without guarantees of delivery or order. Unlike TCP, UDP is a <b>connectionless</b> transport protocol, meaning it does not establish a connection before sending data.</p>
<p>It is part of the <b>TCP/IP</b> protocol suite, like TCP, but UDP stands out for its simplicity and efficiency in certain situations, particularly where speed and low latency are prioritized over reliability.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md118"></a>
&lt;strong&gt;Principle of Operation of UDP&lt;/strong&gt;</h3>
<p>UDP is designed to be fast and lightweight. It lacks the complex connection management and reliable transmission mechanisms of TCP, which helps reduce delays and network overhead:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Direct Packet Sending</b>: Unlike TCP, UDP does not perform a connection step. Data (datagrams) are simply sent from one point to another without confirmation of receipt.</li>
<li><b>Absence of Reliability Mechanism</b>: UDP does not guarantee that data reaches its destination, and packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order without any correction.</li>
<li><b>Unordered Transmission</b>: Since there is no segmentation numbering like in TCP, UDP does not guarantee that datagrams arrive in the order they were sent.</li>
<li><b>No Flow or Congestion Control</b>: Unlike TCP, UDP does not regulate data flow or account for network congestion, making it faster but riskier in case of network overload.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md119"></a>
&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of UDP&lt;/strong&gt;</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Speed</b>: Since there is no prior connection step or reliable transmission management mechanism, UDP is much faster than TCP. It is ideal for applications where latency must be minimized, such as online gaming, VoIP calls, or live streaming.</li>
<li><b>Low Overhead</b>: UDP generates very little header overhead, as it does not need to manage mechanisms like acknowledgments or segment numbering. This allows for a high data throughput.</li>
<li><b>Non-blocking Transmission</b>: UDP does not wait for confirmation from the recipient to continue sending data, making it non-blocking and avoiding retransmission delays that can slow down exchanges.</li>
</ul>

Using UDP for in game communication</h2>
<p>In the context of our game, we chose to use UDP for communication between the client and the server due to the characteristics mentioned above, which perfectly match the needs of a dynamic and responsive application. Here’s how this is reflected in our architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Real-Time Event Transmission</b>: UDP allows for the rapid sending of datagrams containing critical information about player actions, such as movements, attacks, or state changes. This approach ensures that players receive game state updates almost instantly, which is essential for maintaining immersion and responsiveness in a gaming environment.</li>
<li><b>Latency Management</b>: By using UDP, we minimize communication delays. Each action from a player is immediately transmitted to the server without waiting for confirmations. This is particularly important during real-time competitions, where every millisecond counts.</li>
<li><b>Bandwidth Efficiency</b>: Due to the low overhead of UDP, we can send more information with less data. This frees up bandwidth for other operations while maintaining a high throughput for game-related information.</li>
<li><b>Game Data Updates</b>: Information regarding player states, scores, and environmental changes is sent via UDP. While we accept that some packets may be lost or arrive out of order, the gaming experience remains fluid. Essential data, such as player positions, is regularly updated to ensure that the game stays synchronized, even if some packets are occasionally missing.</li>
<li><b>Tolerance for Packet Loss</b>: The game is designed to be tolerant of packet loss, which is an inherent characteristic of UDP. The game mechanics are robust enough to handle missing information without harming the overall player experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md122"></a>
&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;</h3>
<p>Using UDP for communication between the client and server of our game allows us to achieve optimal performance. By quickly sending critical information and reducing latency, we have created a smooth and dynamic gaming experience that meets the demands of real-time games. This approach enables us to leverage the advantages of UDP while intelligently managing the risks associated with its unreliable nature.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md151"></a>
Storage</h2>
<p>For data storage in our R-Type inspired game, we opted for the use of <b>JSON configuration files</b>. This choice was motivated by several practical advantages, including simplicity, readability, and compatibility.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md152"></a>
Why JSON?</h3>
<p>The <b>JSON</b> (JavaScript Object Notation) format is lightweight, easy to read, and widely supported in almost all development environments. It allows for structured data to be stored in a textual format, making it ideal for video game configuration, especially in a prototype where flexibility and simplicity are desired.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md153"></a>
Use Cases in Our Project</h3>
<p>We used JSON files to manage the following configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Level Parameters</b> Each game level is described in a JSON file, specifying information such as the number of enemies, types of obstacles, and boss spawn parameters.</li>
<li><b>Player Profiles</b> Information such as score, life, or player status is recorded in JSON files, allowing for flexible and simple management of this data.</li>
<li><b>Game Configurations</b> Global game parameters (like controls, difficulty, or graphical options) are also stored as a JSON file, allowing players to easily customize them.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md154"></a>
Advantages of JSON Format</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Ease of Use</b> JSON is easy to manipulate for both reading and writing, with native support in many languages (such as <b>C++</b>, via third-party libraries).</li>
<li><b>Human Readability</b> JSON files are clear and can be directly edited by developers or game designers without needing specialized tools.</li>
<li><b>Flexibility</b> JSON allows for the representation of complex structures (nested objects, arrays) while remaining lightweight and easy to manage.</li>
<li><b>Portability</b> The JSON format is platform-independent, facilitating compatibility with other systems, servers, or configuration tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md155"></a>
Limitations of JSON Format</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Not Optimized for Large Volumes of Data</b> If the game were to evolve into more complex systems with large amounts of data to manage (e.g., millions of players or gigantic maps), the JSON format would become inefficient in terms of performance.</li>
<li><b>Lack of Transaction Mechanisms</b> Unlike a relational database, JSON does not have mechanisms for handling transactions or ensuring data consistency in case of failures or interruptions when writing files.</li>
</ul>
